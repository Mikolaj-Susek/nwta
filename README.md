## How to setup

To run a specific task, navigate to the corresponding folder (e.g., assignment-1). Then, build the container using the command.

> Important: Application containers must be run one at a time because they operate on the same address (127.0.0.1) and port (8080).
```bash 
docker-compose up -d
```

## Automation templates

Repository contains folders to automate tasks for each assignment.
Each folder is named by the assignment number (e.g., assignment-1-auto, assignment-2-auto, etc.).
